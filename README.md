# YA Pokemon TCG SDK (Yet Another Pokemon TCG SDK)

A modern JavaScript SDK for interacting with the Pokemon Trading Card Game API. This is "Yet Another" implementation of the Pokemon TCG SDK, providing a more intuitive interface and additional features for accessing Pokemon TCG card data, set information, and market prices.

## Why Another SDK?

While there are existing Pokemon TCG SDKs (like the original [pokemon-tcg-sdk-javascript](https://github.com/PokemonTCG/pokemon-tcg-sdk-javascript)), this implementation aims to provide:

- üöÄ Modern JavaScript features and async/await syntax
- üì¶ ES Modules support
- üîÑ Improved error handling
- üéØ Better TypeScript support
- üí° Enhanced documentation
- üõ†Ô∏è Additional utility methods
- üîç Improved search capabilities
- üí∞ Enhanced market data integration

## Features

- üîç Search and retrieve Pokemon TCG cards
- üì¶ Access set information and details
- üí∞ Get card prices from TCGPlayer and CardMarket
- üéÆ Check card legality in different formats
- üñºÔ∏è Access card and set images
- üìä Comprehensive card data including:
  - Card types and evolution stages
  - Abilities and attacks
  - Weaknesses and resistances
  - Ancient traits
  - Pokedex numbers
  - Artist information
  - Rarity and flavor text

## Installation

```bash
npm install pokemon-tcg-yajs-sdk
```

## Usage

### Configuration

First, you need to configure the SDK with your API key:

```javascript
import pokemon from 'pokemon-tcg-yajs-sdk';

// Configure with your API key
pokemon.configure('your-api-key-here');
```

### Finding Cards

```javascript
// Find a specific card by ID
const card = await pokemon.cards.find('xy7-54');

// Search for cards
const cards = await pokemon.cards.where('name:charizard');

// Get all cards (with optional filters)
const allCards = await pokemon.cards.all({
  q: 'set.id:base1',
  orderBy: 'name'
});
```

### Working with Card Data

```javascript
// Check card type
if (card.isPokemon()) {
  // Check evolution stage
  if (card.isBasic()) {
    console.log('This is a Basic Pokemon');
  }
}

// Get card details
const cardName = card.getName();
const cardType = card.getTypes();
const cardHP = card.hp;
const cardRarity = card.getRarity();

// Check card legality
if (card.isLegal('standard')) {
  console.log('This card is legal in Standard format');
}

// Get card prices
const tcgplayerPrice = card.getPrice('tcgplayer', 'market');
const cardmarketPrice = card.getPrice('cardmarket');

// Get card images
const cardImage = card.getImageUrl('large');
const setSymbol = card.getSetSymbol();
```

### Working with Sets

```javascript
// Find a specific set
const set = await pokemon.types.card.Set.find('base1');

// Get set information
const setName = set.getName();
const setSeries = set.getSeries();
const releaseDate = set.getReleaseDate();
const totalCards = set.getTotal();

// Get set images
const setSymbol = set.getSymbolUrl();
const setLogo = set.getLogoUrl();
```
